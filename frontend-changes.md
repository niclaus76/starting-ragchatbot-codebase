# Frontend Code Quality Tools Implementation

## Overview
Added comprehensive code quality tools to the RAG chatbot development workflow, focusing on Python code formatting and quality checks.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Added
Updated `pyproject.toml` to include essential code quality tools:
- **Black** (>=23.0.0) - Automatic code formatting
- **isort** (>=5.12.0) - Import statement sorting
- **flake8** (>=6.0.0) - Code linting and style checking
- **pre-commit** (>=3.0.0) - Git hooks for automated quality checks

### 2. Configuration Files

#### `pyproject.toml` Configuration
- **Black configuration**: 88-character line length, Python 3.11+ target, excludes build/cache directories
- **isort configuration**: Black-compatible profile with consistent import formatting
- **flake8 configuration**: 88-character line length, ignores Black-compatible rules (E203, W503)

#### `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
Pre-commit hooks configuration for automated quality checks:
- Black formatting
- isort import sorting  
- flake8 linting
- Basic file checks (trailing whitespace, EOF, YAML validation, etc.)

### 3. Development Scripts

Created `scripts/` directory with quality check automation:

#### `scripts/format.py`
- Automated code formatting using Black and isort
- Runs on `backend/`, `main.py`, and `scripts/` directories
- Provides detailed feedback with success/failure status
- Cross-platform Python script

#### `scripts/lint.py`
- Comprehensive code quality checking
- Runs flake8 linting, import sorting validation, and format checking
- Allows failures and provides actionable feedback
- Suggests running format script when issues are found

#### `scripts/quality-check.sh` (Linux/Mac)
- Complete quality workflow script
- Installs dependencies, runs formatting, and performs quality checks
- Bash script for Unix-based systems

#### `scripts/quality-check.bat` (Windows)
- Windows batch file equivalent of quality-check.sh
- Same functionality with Windows-specific commands
- Includes pause for output review

### 4. Documentation Updates

#### `CLAUDE.md` Updates
Added new "Code Quality" section with commands:
- `python scripts/format.py` - Auto-format code
- `python scripts/lint.py` - Run quality checks
- `scripts/quality-check.sh` or `.bat` - Full workflow
- `uv run pre-commit install` - Setup automated hooks

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Start
1. **Install dependencies**: `uv sync`
2. **Format code**: `python scripts/format.py`
3. **Check quality**: `python scripts/lint.py`
4. **Full workflow**: `scripts/quality-check.sh` (or `.bat` on Windows)

### Optional Pre-commit Setup
```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```
This enables automatic quality checks on every git commit.

### Integration with Development Workflow
- Run formatting before committing changes
- Use quality checks in CI/CD pipelines
- Integrate with IDEs that support Black/flake8

## Benefits

### Code Consistency
- Uniform formatting across the entire codebase
- Consistent import organization
- Standardized line lengths and style

### Developer Experience  
- Automated formatting reduces manual work
- Clear feedback on code quality issues
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows/Mac/Linux)

### Quality Assurance
- Catches potential style and quality issues early
- Enforces best practices through linting
- Optional pre-commit hooks prevent poor quality commits

## Architecture Integration

The code quality tools integrate seamlessly with the existing RAG system architecture:
- No impact on runtime performance
- Maintained compatibility with existing FastAPI backend
- Enhanced developer workflow without affecting user-facing functionality
- Supports the existing uv-based dependency management
